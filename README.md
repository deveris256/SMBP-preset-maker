# SMBP: Preset Maker Module

A module for an upcoming SMBP (Starfield Multi Batch Processor) addon.
On itself, the Preser Maker module is for creating txt morph presets based on shape-keys of an object for use with the Starfield game.

## How to use
At first, find the "Starfield" category at the right panel near to the 3D viewport (press "N" to expand said panel)

Then,
1. Enter a path to a folder where txt preset will be saved;
2. Select an object with shape-keys;
3. Press the Save txt preset button.

A txt preset will be created for ready to use in-game.
